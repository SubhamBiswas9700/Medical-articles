This project focuses on Healthcare Data Analysis and Visualization by combining Python-based data scraping and machine learning with interactive Power BI dashboards. It begins by scraping healthcare news articles from Medical News Today using Python and BeautifulSoup, followed by structured analysis of a hospital dataset containing patient demographics, medical history, billing, and test results. Using pandas and scikit-learn, the project predicts patient length of stay based on age and billing amount. Finally, Power BI is used to build an insightful dashboard that visualizes admission trends, insurance coverage, medical condition distribution, medication effectiveness, and doctor/hospital performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven healthcare decisions.
